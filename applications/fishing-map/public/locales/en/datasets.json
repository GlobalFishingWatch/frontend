Data is collected using Ecuador's vessel monitoring system via satellites and is published on a seven-day delay containing information on vessels’ identity, location, speed, course, and movement. Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms developed for automatic identification system (AIS) to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point from vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch’s fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy, and quality. Global Fishing Watch is continually improving its algorithms across all broadcast data formats to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity when fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as apparent rather than certain. Any and all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at the user’s discretion. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers and is combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data, resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events.

    "description": "\nVessel monitoring system (VMS) data is provided by the National Directorate of Aquatic Spaces of the Ecuadorian Navy. Data is collected using Ecuador's vessel monitoring system via satellites and is published on a seven-day delay containing information on vessels’ identity, location, speed, course, and movement. Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms developed for automatic identification system (AIS) to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point from vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch’s fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy, and quality. Global Fishing Watch is continually improving its algorithms across all broadcast data formats to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity when fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as apparent rather than certain. Any and all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at the user’s discretion. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers and is combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data, resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and to improve automated classification techniques.\n",

    "name": "Night light detections",
    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night. <br/><br/>\n\nThe satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. <br/><br/>\n\nGlobal Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily. Read more about this product, and download the data <a href='https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html' target='_blank' rel=noopener'>here</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nThose using night light detections data should acknowledge the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat detection. A filtration algorithm has been applied but there may still be some mis-identification. <br/><br/>\n\nThe GFW layer includes quality flags (QF), including a filter to show only detections which NOAA has classified as vessels (QF1).",

VMS broadcasts data quite differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy and quality. Over time our algorithms will improve across all our broadcast data formats. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithm for VMS, as for AIS, is a best effort to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified, or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch fishing detection algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events.

Permission to include Peruvian Data required that a 10 day delay to publishing was implemented. The data is collected using their Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) via satellites and terrestrial receivers, and contains a vessel’s identity gear type, location, speed, direction and more. The activity layer displays a heatmap of vessel presence. The presence is determined by taking one position per day per vessel from the positions transmitted by VMS. \n",
