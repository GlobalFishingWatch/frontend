    "description": "Nous utilisons des données sur l’identité, le type, l’emplacement, la vitesse, la direction, etc, diffusées à l'aide du système AIS (Automatic Identification System) et recueillie via les satellites et les récepteurs terrestres. Nous analysons les données AIS recueillies auprès des navires que nos recherches ont identifiés comme des navires de pêche commerciaux connus ou possibles, et appliquons un algorithme de détection de la pêche pour déterminer l' « activité de pêche apparente » en fonction des changements de vitesse et de direction des navires. L'algorithme classifie chaque point de données diffusées par l'AIS pour ces navires comme étant apparemment de la pêche ou non, ce qui est montré sur notre carte de chaleur de l'activité de pêche."

These organizations are international organizations formed by countries with a shared interest in managing or conserving an area’s fish stock. Some RFMOs manage all the fish stocks found in a specific area, while others focus on particular highly migratory species, notably tuna, throughout vast geographical areas. The RFMO Layer on the Global Fishing Watch map currently includes the five tuna RFMOs."
