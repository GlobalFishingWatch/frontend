    "description": "Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vessel’s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing detection algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction. The algorithm classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. AIS data as broadcast may vary in completeness, accuracy and quality. Also, data collection by satellite or terrestrial receivers may introduce errors through missing or inaccurate data. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithm is a best effort mathematically to identify “apparent fishing activity.” As a result, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified as such by Global Fishing Watch; conversely, Global Fishing Watch may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies designations of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch is taking steps to make sure fishing activity designations are as accurate as possible. Global Fishing Watch fishing detection algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and automated classification techniques."

    "description": "This layer uses the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data provided by the Chilean government’s fisheries and aquaculture regulator, SERNAPESCA. It is also possible to use the FILTERS tab in our toolbox to view separately Chile’s VMS data for small-scale fishing vessels(<18 meters) and industrial fishing vessels (>18 meters). Note that there are a few vessels that are <18 meters but considered industrial because they were registered in the capture of industrial quotas. SERNAPESCA is also using our map to visualize and track vessel positions for their fleet, including vessels involved in aquaculture. (Visit the map within SERNAPESCA’s website. The data is collected using Chile’s VMS via satellites and terrestrial receivers and contains vessel identities, gear type, location, speed, direction and more. Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms we developed for AIS data to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point from vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data quite differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy and quality. Over time our algorithms will improve across all our broadcast data formats. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithm for VMS, as for AIS, is a best effort to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified, or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing,” and “fishing effort,” as “apparent” rather than certain.

    "description": "Sea Surface Salinity is a key parameter to estimate the influence of oceans on climate. Along with temperature, salinity is a key factor that determines the density of ocean water and thus determines the convection and re-emergence of water masses. The thermohaline circulation crosses all the oceans in surface and at depth, driven by temperature and salinity. A global “conveyor belt” is a simple model of the large-scale thermohaline circulation. Deep-water forms in the North Atlantic, sinks, moves south, circulates around Antarctica, and finally enters the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic basins. Currents bring cold water masses from North to South and vice versa. This thermohaline circulation greatly influences the formation of sea ice at the world’s poles, and carries ocean food sources and sea life around the planet, as well as affects rainfall patterns, wind patterns, hurricanes and monsoons."

    "name": "Chlorophyll concentration",
    "description": "Chlorophyll-a is the light-harvesting pigment found in all photosynthetic plants. Its concentration in the ocean is used as an index of phytoplankton biomass and, as such, is a key input to primary productivity models. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites measures ocean color every day, from which global chlorophyll-a concentrations are derived. Ocean phytoplankton chemically fix carbon through photosynthesis, taking in dissolved carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Through this process, marine plants capture about an equal amount of carbon as does photosynthesis by land vegetation. Changes in the amount of phytoplankton indicate the change in productivity of the oceans and provide a key ocean link for global climate change monitoring. Scientists use chlorophyll in modeling Earth's biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon cycle or the nitrogen cycle. Additionally, on short time scales, chlorophyll can be used to trace oceanographic currents, jets, and plumes. The 1-km resolution and nearly daily global coverage of the MODIS data thus allows scientists to observe mesoscale oceanographic features in coastal and estuarine environments, which are of increasing importance in marine science studies."
