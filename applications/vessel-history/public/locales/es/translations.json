You can find more detail in our Technology page: <6>https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-technology/</6> and Dataset page: <10>https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/</10>.",

Ports are based upon the Global Fishing Watch anchorages dataset, a global database of anchorage locations where vessels congregate."
