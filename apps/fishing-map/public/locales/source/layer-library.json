    "name": "Apparent fishing effort",
    "description": "To determine “apparent fishing effort”, Global Fishing Watch analyzes automatic identification system (AIS) and vessel monitoring system (VMS) data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels and applies a fishing detection algorithm based on changes in vessel speed and direction.",

    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.",

    "description": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can detect at-sea vessels and structures in any weather conditions. SAR is a satellite-based sensor that shoots microwaves to the Earth surface and measures the amplitude and phase of the signals that are reflected back from objects on the ground and water, known as backscatter.",
