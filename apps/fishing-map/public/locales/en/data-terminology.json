The higher the coverage percentage, the greater confidence on the accuracy of events listed to represent the vessel’s actual activities.</p><p> To calculate the coverage metric, all voyages linked to a vessel in the selected time range are segmented into one hour blocks, and the proportion of each hour block a vessel in a voyage has at least one AIS transmission. An ‘N/A’ value could be due to no reported activity for the vessel in the selected time range.

  "insightsGaps": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p> <span >AIS devices are designed to continually broadcast a vessel’s position to avoid collisions. Thus, when a vessel has an extended gap in AIS transmissions or positions, it can potentially indicate intentional AIS disabling or suspicious behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span > </p> <p> <span >The AIS off events insight is based on the time range of interest.&nbsp;</span > </p> <p> <span >Global Fishing Watch records all AIS gap events over six hours, and then applies a set of filters below to identify those gaps we believe to be intentional AIS disabling rather than technical failures. The filter criteria for ‘likely disabling’ are:&nbsp;</span > </p> <ul> <li>The gap event must be at least 12 hours;</li> <li>The gap must start at least 50 nautical miles (nm) from shore;</li> <li> The gap must start in an area with a satellite reception quality greater than 10 positions per day; </li> <li> The vessel must have at least 14 satellite positions in the 12 hours prior to the gap. </li> </ul> <h2>Caveats</h2> <ul> <li> The dataset used to formulate this insight remains in <strong> <em>prototype</em> </strong> stage, which means it is still under quality assurance processes with possibility of data issues and may not include the most up-to-date data points or changes. </li> <li> Gaps outside of the above filter criteria (e.g. activity within 50 nm) are not recognised. Using this AIS off events insight to evaluate activity within 50 nm from shore for example would be uninformative and potentially misleading.&nbsp; </li> <li> Gaps shorter than 12 hours are not considered for this insight due to variability of satellite orbit timings.&nbsp; </li> <li> Gap events less than 50 nm from shore (inshore) are also not considered, due to differences in satellite and terrestrial AIS with satellite AIS reception generally decreases closer to shore coupled by higher vessel density resulting in signal interference. </li> <li> The AIS reception quality estimates used to identify the insights are based on data for 2017- 2019 from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq2109\" > <span>Welch et al. (2022)</span> </a> while we work to automate monthly estimates from 2019 until present day. </li> <li> While the insight aims to provide ‘likely AIS disabling’ events, the insight is unable to confirm whether the gap events are intentional. </li> <li> We recommend referencing additional information sources and request supporting records from the vessel for comprehensive AIS gap events review.&nbsp; </li> </ul>",

The insights do not consider AIS based vessel flag identity. </li> <li> The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tokyo-mou.org/\"> <span>Tokyo</span> </a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://parismou.org/\"> <span>Paris</span> </a> MOU lists have been obtained consistently by GFW since mid-2021, and the insight is based on flag identity on and after 2021, not before. </li> <li>The data is maintained on an annual basis.</li> <li> While every attempt is made to ensure the insight provided is accurate and up-to-date, this cannot be guaranteed, particularly on any changes outside of the annual data update cycle. </li> </ul>",
  "insightsIUU": "<h2>Overview</h2><p> <span>This insight presents illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) listing status according to the official Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) IUU vessel lists.

To view the vessel’s latest status, please adjust the end date of the timebar to the present date. Vessels that were on the RFMO IUU list in the past and have since been delisted (for example because of a change in ownership, or because the vessel is no longer in service), or have never been listed are indicated as ‘not listed’.</span> </p> <h2>Caveats</h2> <ul> <li>This insight is kept up-to-date periodically since 2017.</li> <li>The insight includes data from 13 official RFMO IUU vessel lists* only.
