# i18n Workflow

The project uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/), a library on top of the standard i18n features. To integrate it with react we use [i18n-react integration](https://react.i18next.com/)

## Configuration

i18n is configured [here](applications/fishing-map/src/features/i18n/i18n.ts) following this [spec](https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options).

## Debug

Set the `i18n_DEBUG` .env variable to true to see logs in console

## Translations

The source file, and its translations are located at the [locales folder](applications/fishing-map/public/locales, served by HTTP and managed by [backend-plugin](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend).

To handle translations we use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gfw-frontend). It uses a GitHub bot to detect changes in the source files and creates a PR to update the translations once the editors review them.

Developers don't need to update the translations for each language directly, only the source/[namespace].json files.

For shared translations there is a [i18n-labels](../../packages/i18n-labels) package which includes all of the:

- datasets
- flags
- timebar

Deployed to npm and ready to be consume in the following pattern:

```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@globalfishingwatch/i18n-labels@latest/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json
```

In case you release a hotfix and want to ensure the cache is purged use:

```text
https://purge.jsdelivr.net/npm/@globalfishingwatch/i18n-labels@latest/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json
```

For example:

```text
https://purge.jsdelivr.net/npm/@globalfishingwatch/i18n-labels@latest/en/datasets.json
```

## Keys extraction

[i18n-parser](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser) script syncs the code and the translations extracting the keys to the `source/translations.json` file. It's configured [here](applications/fishing-map/i18next-parser.config.js). Tu execute it, run:

```bash
yarn i18n:parser
```

i18n-parser doesn't identify dynamic keys, to fix it use [this workaround](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser#caveats). (e.g. `VesselLayerPanel` component with API vessel.flag or vessel.shipname dynamic responses)

## Other translations

There are external data that has to be translated as well, like country names, dataset information, etc... this is archieved with i18next [namespaces](https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces) to separate translations into multiple files, (e.g. `flags.json` used for the country names).

To consume translations from a namespace different than the default one, add it as a prefix (e.g. `flags:ESP` in `I18nFlag` component).

##Â Helper components

- [`I18nFlag`](applications/fishing-map/src/features/i18n/i18nFlag.tsx)
- [`I18nDate`](applications/fishing-map/src/features/i18n/i18nDate.tsx) using [luxon formatting](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/class/src/datetime.js~DateTime.html)
- [`I18nNumber`](applications/fishing-map/src/features/i18n/i18nNumber.tsx)

# Datasets translations workflow

- Datasets sources are updated from `datasets-versioning` published in PROD with `translate: true`
- Datasets sources and translations are merged into develop thru pull requests. When a PR that contains chanes to `i18n-labels` contents is merged into develop
  - The Github action `.github/workflows/i18n-labels-publish.yml` is executed with the purpose of
    - Detecting and bumping `i18n-labels` version if needed
    - Update `i18n-labels@latest`
    - Publish the new package to npm
    - Purge the cache in jsdelivr for `@latest`
