    "fishing": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible fishing vessels, and applies a fishing detection algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction.</li>\n  <li>Our machine learning model classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing.</li>\n  <li>Fishing events use those data points as input and summarize them into one event for easier analysis. </li>\n  <li>A fishing event is defined where: <ul>\n      <li>Fishing positions appear consecutively and are separated by less than 10 kilometers or 2 hours; and,</li>\n      <li>Fishing positions within 1 hour and 2 kilometers of another fishing event are grouped together into a single event.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>The dataset is further restricted by removing fishing events that are brief and fast, as these are less likely to indicate a realistic fishing event. The following short fishing events are removed: <ul>\n      <li>Events less than 20 minutes in duration;</li>\n      <li>Events comprised of five or fewer fishing positions;</li>\n      <li>Events that cover distance of less than 0.5 km (for all gears except estimated squid gear);</li>\n      <li>Events that cover distance of less than 50m (for estimated squid gear); and,</li>\n      <li>Abnormally fast moving vessel events with an average vessel speed of 10 knots or greater. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Caveats</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>False positives may appear in the dataset where vessel’s slow down and change direction, but aren’t engaged in fishing activity.</li>\n  <li>Our machine learning model is better at predicting some types of fishing (e.g. trawling and longlining) compared to other types of fishing that may not have been as present in data used to train the machine learning model.</li>\n  <li>Most AIS devices fall into one of three “classes”: Class A, Class B, and Class B+. Class A devices broadcast at a stronger power and they broadcast a vessel’s position more frequently. Lower wattage Class B and B+ devices are detected less frequently by satellites, and therefore it may seem there is less fishing activity in areas where they are predominantly used. </li>\n  <li>In addition to areas with low satellite coverage, areas with a high density of vessel traffic can also limit the number of signals processed, particularly related to Class B (or B+) AIS systems. This may lead to reduced or underestimated vessel activity in the Global Fishing Watch map or data in such areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Learn more</h2><a href='https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-technology/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Learn more about our estimation of apparent fishing effort.</a>",

A vessel’s AIS coverage metric is critical to interpreting vessel activity information. The higher the coverage percentage, the greater confidence on the accuracy of events listed to represent the vessel’s actual activities.</li> <li>To calculate the coverage metric, all voyages linked to a vessel in the selected time range are segmented into one hour blocks, and the proportion of each hour block a vessel in a voyage has at least one AIS transmission. </li> <li>An ‘N/A’ value could be due to no reported activity for the vessel or inactivity (e.g. the vessel undergoing maintenance) in the selected time range. In cases with 0% coverage though there are vessel tracks and AIS events could be due to inconsistent transmission, and the lack of identity and positional information causing discrepancies in the Global Fishing Watch calculation method. In these poor coverage cases, we recommend you check additional information sources, request supporting records from the vessel, or contact Global Fishing Watch with the cases you have questions or would like to report error for.</li> </ul> <h2>Caveats</h2> <ul> <li>The dataset used to formulate this insight remains in <strong>experimental</strong> or <strong>prototype</strong> stage, which means it is still under quality assurance processes with possibility of data issues. </li> <li>As the AIS coverage metric is calculated based on voyages, eg. the vessel’s activity between port visits, coverage is reflective of the time and AIS reception quality while a vessel is active at sea rather than at port.</li> <li>Voyage is defined based on port visits (exit and entry).

    "insightsGaps": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p> <span >AIS devices are designed to continually broadcast a vessel’s position to avoid collisions.
