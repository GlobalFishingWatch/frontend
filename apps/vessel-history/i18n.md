# i18n Workflow

The project uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/), a library on top of the standard i18n features. To integrate it with react we use [i18n-react integration](https://react.i18next.com/)

## Configuration

i18n is configured [here](apps/vessel-history/src/features/i18n/i18n.ts) following this [spec](https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options).

## Debug

Set the `i18n_DEBUG` .env variable to true to see logs in console

## Translations

The source file, and its translations are located at the [locales folder](apps/vessel-history/public/locales), served by HTTP and managed by [backend-plugin](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend).

To handle translations we use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gfw-frontend). It uses a GitHub bot to detect changes in the source files and creates a PR to update the translations once the editors review them.

Developers don't need to update the translations for each language directly, only the source/[namespace].json files.

## Keys extraction

[i18n-parser](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser) script syncs the code and the translations extracting the keys to the `source/translations.json` file. It's configured [here](apps/vessel-history/i18next-parser.config.js). Tu execute it, run:

```bash
yarn i18n:parser
```

i18n-parser doesn't identify dynamic keys, to fix it use [this workaround](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser#caveats). (e.g. `InfoField` and `InfoFieldHistory` component with API vessel.flag or vessel.shipname dynamic responses)

## Other translations

There are external data that has to be translated as well, like country names, dataset information, etc... this is archieved with i18next [namespaces](https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces) to separate translations into multiple files, (e.g. `flags.json` used for the country names).

To consume translations from a namespace different than the default one, add it as a prefix (e.g. `flags:ESP` in `I18nFlag` component).
