          Encounters may indicate potential transshipment activity between two vessels that both
          appear on AIS. Encounters are estimated using AIS data, including distance between the two
          vessels, vessel speeds, and duration in a given area. <br />
          An encounter is defined as when two vessels, a carrier vessel and encountered fishing
          vessel, are detected on AIS data as within 500 meters for at least two hours and traveling
          at a median speed &lt;2 knots, while at least 10 km from a coastal anchorage.
