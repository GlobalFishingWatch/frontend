      A port visit occurs when a vessel has a port Entry, Stop or Gap, and Exit event. This means the vessel is within 3 km of an anchorage (Port Entry), and is moving between 0.5 and 0.2 knots (Port Stop), or within an anchorage but has aa gap in AIS transmission for at least 4 hours (Port Gap), and then the vesselt transits more than 4 km outside of the anchorage point (Port Exit). Ports are based upon the Global Fishing Watch anchorages dataset, a global database of anchorage locations where vessels congregate.
