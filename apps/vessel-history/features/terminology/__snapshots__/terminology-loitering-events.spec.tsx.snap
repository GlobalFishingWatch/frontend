      Loitering is when a single vessel exhibits behavior indicative of a potential encounter event. Loitering is also estimated using AIS data, including vessel speed, duration in a given location, and distance from shore. 
      <br />
      Loitering occurs when a carrier vessel travels at average speed of &lt;2 knots.
      <br />
      Due to the individual definitions of loitering events and encounter events, it is possible for a loitering event to overlap with encounter events and to encompass one or more encounter events.
