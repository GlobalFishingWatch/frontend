# Write Unit Tests

## Overview

Create comprehensive unit tests for the current code and generate the test file with proper imports and setup according to the project's testing conventions.

## Steps

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Test all public methods and functions
   - Cover edge cases and error conditions
   - Test both positive and negative scenarios
   - Aim for high code coverage
2. **Test Structure**
   - Use the project's testing framework conventions
   - Write clear, descriptive test names
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Group related tests logically
3. **Test Cases to Include**
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and exception cases
   - Mock external dependencies appropriately
4. **Test Quality**
   - Make tests independent and isolated
   - Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
   - Keep tests simple and focused on one thing
   - Add helpful assertion messages
