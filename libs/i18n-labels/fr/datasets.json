    "description": "Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data is provided by the Belize High Seas Fisheries Unit (BHSFU). Data is collected using Belize's vessel monitoring system via satellites and is published on a three-day delay containing information on vessels’ location, speed, course, and movement. Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms developed for automatic identification system (AIS) to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point from vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch’s fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy, and quality. Global Fishing Watch is continually improving its algorithms across all broadcast data formats to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity when fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as apparent rather than certain. Any and all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at the user’s discretion. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing presence algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers and is combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data, resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and to improve automated classification techniques.",

    "description": "Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vessel’s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing detection algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction. The algorithm classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. AIS data as broadcast may vary in completeness, accuracy and quality. Also, data collection by satellite or terrestrial receivers may introduce errors through missing or inaccurate data. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithm is a best effort mathematically to identify “apparent fishing activity.” As a result, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified as such by Global Fishing Watch; conversely, Global Fishing Watch may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies designations of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk.

Les données sont collectées à l'aide du système de suivi des navires du Costa Rica via des satellites et publiées avec un retard de trois jours. Les données contiennent des informations sur l'emplacement, la vitesse, le cap et le mouvement des navires. Global Fishing Watch analyse ces données en utilisant les mêmes algorithmes développés pour le système d'identification automatique (AIS) afin d'identifier l'activité et les comportements de pêche. L'algorithme classe chaque point de données transmis par les navires comme apparemment en train de pêcher ou non, et affiche le premier sur la carte thermique de l'activité de pêche de Global Fishing Watch. Le système VMS transmet les données différemment de l'AIS et peut fournir différentes mesures d'intégrité, de précision et de qualité. Global Fishing Watch améliore continuellement ses algorithmes dans tous les formats de transmission de données pour identifier de manière algorithmique « l'activité de pêche apparente ». Il est possible qu'aucune activité de pêche ne soit identifiée ou que la carte thermique montre une activité de pêche apparente lorsque la pêche n'a pas lieu. Pour ces raisons, Global Fishing Watch classe les termes « activité de pêche », « pêche » ou « effort de pêche » comme apparents plutôt que vrais. Toutes les informations de Global Fishing Watch sur \"l'activité de pêche apparente\" doivent être considérées comme une estimation et doivent être invoquées uniquement à la discrétion de l'utilisateur. Les algorithmes de détection de pêche de Global Fishing Watch sont développés et testés en utilisant des données d'événements de pêche réelles collectées par des observateurs et combinées à une analyse experte des données de mouvement des navires AIS, résultant en une classification manuelle de milliers d'événements de pêche connus. Global Fishing Watch collabore également étroitement avec des chercheurs universitaires dans le cadre de son programme de recherche pour partager les données de classification des activités de pêche et améliorer les techniques de classification automatisées",

    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. Global Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily. Read more about this product, and download the data <a href=\"https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.Those using night light detections data should acknowledge the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat presence. A filtration algorithm has been applied but there may still be some mis-identification. The GFW layer includes quality flags (QF), including a filter to show only detections which NOAA has classified as vessels (QF1)",

AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing detection algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction. The algorithm classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map.

    "description": "Les données du système de surveillance des navires par satellite (VMS) sont fournies par l'Institut costaricien des pêches et de l'aquaculture. Les données sont collectées à l'aide du système de suivi des navires du Costa Rica via des satellites et publiées avec un retard de trois jours. Les données contiennent des informations sur l'emplacement, la vitesse, le cap et le mouvement des navires. Global Fishing Watch analyse ces données en utilisant les mêmes algorithmes développés pour le système d'identification automatique (AIS) afin d'identifier l'activité et les comportements de pêche. L'algorithme classe chaque point de données transmis par les navires comme apparemment en train de pêcher ou non, et affiche le premier sur la carte thermique de l'activité de pêche de Global Fishing Watch. Le système VMS transmet les données différemment de l'AIS et peut fournir différentes mesures d'intégrité, de précision et de qualité. Global Fishing Watch améliore continuellement ses algorithmes dans tous les formats de transmission de données pour identifier de manière algorithmique « l'activité de pêche apparente ». Il est possible qu'aucune activité de pêche ne soit identifiée ou que la carte thermique montre une activité de pêche apparente lorsque la pêche n'a pas lieu. Pour ces raisons, Global Fishing Watch classe les termes « activité de pêche », « pêche » ou « effort de pêche » comme apparents plutôt que vrais. Toutes les informations de Global Fishing Watch sur \"l'activité de pêche apparente\" doivent être considérées comme une estimation et doivent être invoquées uniquement à la discrétion de l'utilisateur. Les algorithmes de détection de pêche de Global Fishing Watch sont développés et testés en utilisant des données d'événements de pêche réelles collectées par des observateurs et combinées à une analyse experte des données de mouvement des navires AIS, résultant en une classification manuelle de milliers d'événements de pêche connus. Global Fishing Watch collabore également étroitement avec des chercheurs universitaires dans le cadre de son programme de recherche pour partager les données de classification des activités de pêche et améliorer les techniques de classification automatisées",

    "description": "Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vessel’s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing presence algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction. The algorithm classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. AIS data as broadcast may vary in completeness, accuracy and quality. Also, data collection by satellite or terrestrial receivers may introduce errors through missing or inaccurate data. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing presence algorithm is a best effort mathematically to identify “apparent fishing activity.” As a result, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified as such by Global Fishing Watch; conversely, Global Fishing Watch may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies designations of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch is taking steps to make sure fishing activity designations are as accurate as possible. Global Fishing Watch fishing presence algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and automated classification techniques.",

    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. Global Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily. Read more about this product, and download the data <a href=\"https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.Those using night light detections data should acknowledge the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat presence. A filtration algorithm has been applied but there may still be some mis-identification. The GFW layer includes quality flags (QF), including a filter to show only detections which NOAA has classified as vessels (QF1)",

Along with temperature, salinity is a key factor that determines the density of ocean water and thus determines the convection and re-emergence of water masses. The thermohaline circulation crosses all the oceans in surface and at depth, driven by temperature and salinity. A global “conveyor belt” is a simple model of the large-scale thermohaline circulation. Deep-water forms in the North Atlantic, sinks, moves south, circulates around Antarctica, and finally enters the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic basins. Currents bring cold water masses from north to south and vice versa. This thermohaline circulation greatly influences the formation of sea ice at the world’s poles, and carries ocean food sources and sea life around the planet, as well as affects rainfall patterns, wind patterns, hurricanes and monsoons.

Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms developed for automatic identification system (AIS) data to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data quite differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy and quality. Over time our algorithms will improve across all our broadcast data formats. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithm for VMS, as for AIS, is a best effort to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified, or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch fishing detection algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and automated classification techniques.",

    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. Global Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily. Read more about this product, and download the data <a href=\"https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.Those using night light detections data should acknowledge the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat presence. A filtration algorithm has been applied but there may still be some mis-identification. The GFW layer includes quality flags (QF), including a filter to show only detections which NOAA has classified as vessels (QF1)",
