    "description": "Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data is provided by the Belize High Seas Fisheries Unit (BHSFU). Data is collected using Belize's vessel monitoring system via satellites and is published on a three-day delay containing information on vessels’ location, speed, course, and movement. Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms developed for automatic identification system (AIS) to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point from vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch’s fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy, and quality. Global Fishing Watch is continually improving its algorithms across all broadcast data formats to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity when fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as apparent rather than certain. Any and all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at the user’s discretion. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing presence algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers and is combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data, resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and to improve automated classification techniques.",

    "description": "Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vessel’s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing detection algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction. The algorithm classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. AIS data as broadcast may vary in completeness, accuracy and quality. Also, data collection by satellite or terrestrial receivers may introduce errors through missing or inaccurate data. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing detection algorithm is a best effort mathematically to identify “apparent fishing activity.” As a result, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified as such by Global Fishing Watch; conversely, Global Fishing Watch may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies designations of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch is taking steps to make sure fishing activity designations are as accurate as possible. Global Fishing Watch fishing detection algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and automated classification techniques.",

Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. Global Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily.

When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat presence.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>Offshore fixed infrastructure is a global dataset that uses AI and machine learning to detect and classify structures throughout the world’s oceans.</p> <p>Classification labels (oil, wind, and unknown) are provided, as well as confidence levels (high, medium, or low) reflecting our certainty in the assigned label. Detections can be filtered and colored on the map using both label and confidence level.<em></em>The data is updated on a monthly basis, and new classified detections are added at the beginning of every month. Viewing change using the timebar is simple, and allows anyone to recognize the rapid industrialization of the world’s oceans. For example, you can easily observe the expansion of wind farms in the North and East China Seas, or changes in oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico or Persian Gulf.</p> <p>By overlaying the existing map layers, you can explore how vessels interact with oil and wind structures, visualise the density of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) vessel detections around infrastructure, or determine which marine protected areas (MPAs) contain wind, oil, or other infrastructure types. These are only examples of the types of questions we can now ask. Offshore fixed infrastructure is a first of its kind dataset that not only brings to light the extensive industrialization of our oceans, but enables users across industries to use this information in research, monitoring and management.</p> <h2>Use cases</h2> <ul> <li>Maritime domain awareness</li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure locations can support maritime domain awareness, and understanding of other activities occurring at sea.</li> <li>Infrastructure data supports assessments of ocean industrialization, facilitating monitoring of areas experiencing build-up or new development</li> </ul> <li>Monitoring vessels</li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure locations can be used to analyse the behaviour of vessels associated with infrastructure, including grouping vessels based on their interaction with oil and wind structures.</li> <li>Interactions between vessels and infrastructure can help quantify the resources required to support offshore industrial activity</li> <li>The impacts of infrastructure on fishing, including attracting or deterring fishing, can be analysed.</li> </ul> <li>Marine protected areas (MPAs) and marine spatial planning</li> <ul> <li>During the planning stage in the designation of new protected areas, knowing the location of existing infrastructure will be vital to understand which stakeholders shall be included in the consultation process, to understand potential conflicts, and identify easy wins.</li> </ul> <li>Environmental impacts</li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure locations can be used to help detect marine pollution events, and to differentiate between types of pollution events (e.g. pollution from vessels versus pollution from platforms)</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Caveats</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites do not sample most of the open ocean.</strong></li> <ul> <li>Most industrial activity happens relatively close to shore.</li> <li>The extent and frequency of SAR acquisitions is determined by the mission priorities.</li> <li>For more info see: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8/figures/5</li> </ul> <li><strong>We do not provide detections of infrastructure within 1 km of shore</strong></li> <ul> <li>We do not classify objects within 1 km of shore because it is difficult to map where the shoreline begins, and ambiguous coastlines and rocks cause false positives.</li> <li>The bulk of industrial activities, including offshore development with medium-to-large oil rigs and wind farms, occur several kilometers from shore.</li> </ul> <li> <strong>False positives can be produced from noise artifacts.</strong> </li> <ul> <li>Rocks, small islands, sea ice, radar ambiguities (radar echoes), and image artifacts can cause false positives</li> <li>Detections in some areas including Southern Chile, the Arctic, and the Norwegian Sea have been filtered to remove noise.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Spatial coverage varies over time, which can produce different detections results year on year - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://share.cleanshot.com/yG0qfF\"> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Example</span> </a></strong> </li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure detentions from 2017-01-01 to near real time are available, and updated on a monthly basis.</li> </ul> <li> <strong>Labels can change over time</strong> </li> <ul> <li>The label assigned to a structure is the greatest predicted label averaged across time.

All feedback is greatly appreciated.</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Methods</h2> <h3>SAR imagery</h3> <p>We use SAR imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) [1]. The images are sourced from two satellites (S1A and S1B up until December 2021 when S1B stopped operating, and S1A only from 2022 onward) that orbit 180 degrees out of phase with each other in a polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Each satellite has a repeat-cycle of 12 days, so that together they provide a global mapping of coastal waters around the world approximately every six days for the period that both were operating. The number of images per location, however, varies greatly depending on mission priorities, latitude, and degree of overlap between adjacent satellite passes. Spatial coverage also varies over time [2]. Our data consist of dual-polarization images (VH and VV) from the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, with a resolution of about 20 m.</p> <p>[1] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sedas.satapps.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sentinel-1_User_Handbook.pdf\"> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://sedas.satapps.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sentinel-1_User_Handbook.pdf</span> </a> </p> <p>[2]<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario\"> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\"></span> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario</span> </a> </p> <h3>Infrastructure detection by SAR</h3> <p>Detecting infrastructure with SAR is based on the widely used Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, an anomaly detection method conceived for detecting ships in synthetic aperture radar images, that has been modified to remove non-stationary objects. This algorithm is designed to search for pixel values that are unusually bright (the targets) compared to those in the surrounding area (the sea clutter). This method sets a threshold based on the pixel values of the local background (within a window), scanning the whole image pixel-by-pixel. Pixel values above the threshold constitute an anomaly and are likely to be samples from a target.</p> <h3>Infrastructure classification</h3> <p>To classify every detected offshore infrastructure, we used deep learning and designed a ConvNet based on the ConvNeXt architecture. A novel aspect of our deep learning classification approach is the combination of SAR imagery from Sentinel-1 with optical imagery from Sentinel-2. From six-month composites of dual-band SAR (VH and VV) and four-band optical (RGB and NIR) images, we extracted small tiles for every detected fixed infrastructure, with the respective objects at the center of the tile. A single model output includes the probabilities for the specified classes: wind, oil, unknown, lake maracaibo, and noise.</p> <h3>Filtering</h3> <p>GFW post-processed the classified SAR detections to reduce noise (false positives), remove vessels, exclude areas with sea ice at high latitudes, and incorporate expert feedback. We used a clustering approach to identify detections across time (within a 50 m radius) that were likely the same structure but their coordinates differed slightly, and assigned them the greatest average predicted label of the cluster. We also filled in gaps for fixed structures that were missing in one timestep but detected in the previous and following timesteps, and dropped detections appearing in a single timestep. Finally, the dataset underwent extensive manual review and editing by researchers and industry experts in order to refine the final product, and provide the most accurate dataset possible.</p> <h3>Data field descriptions</h3> <p>Each detection has a unique individual identifier (<em>detection_id</em>). A six-month image composite is used in the classification, therefore the <em>detection_date</em> represents the middle of the six month period. This helps to remove non-stationary objects (i.e. vessels), and avoid confusion in the model if a structure is being built, or there isn’t adequate imagery available. <em>structure_id</em> allows you to track a structure through time. There are therefore many <em>detection_id</em> (one for each month the structure is detected) for each <em>structure_id</em>. Labels of <em>wind</em> and <em>oil </em>represent any wind or oil related structure respectively. <em>Unknown</em> represents a structure that is not oil or wind related, such as bridges or navigational buoys. </p> <p>Label confidence levels of ‘High’. ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’ are assigned to each structure, and are conditional on where the detections fell in relation to the boundaries of manually developed wind and oil polygons, and whether the label has changed from the previous month. The <em>label_confidence</em> field can be used to filter analysis. </p> <h2>Resources, code and other notes</h2> <p>Two repos are used in the automation process, both of which are private, and should not be shared publicly.</p> <p>Detection and classification: https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/sentinel-1-ee/tree/master</p> <p>Clustering and reclassification: https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/infrastructure-post-processing</p> <p>All code developed for the paper, Paolo, F.S., Kroodsma, D., Raynor, J. et al.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>Offshore fixed infrastructure is a global dataset that uses AI and machine learning to detect and classify structures throughout the world’s oceans.</p> <p>Classification labels (oil, wind, and unknown) are provided, as well as confidence levels (high, medium, or low) reflecting our certainty in the assigned label. Detections can be filtered and colored on the map using both label and confidence level.<em></em>The data is updated on a monthly basis, and new classified detections are added at the beginning of every month. Viewing change using the timebar is simple, and allows anyone to recognize the rapid industrialization of the world’s oceans. For example, you can easily observe the expansion of wind farms in the North and East China Seas, or changes in oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico or Persian Gulf.</p> <p>By overlaying the existing map layers, you can explore how vessels interact with oil and wind structures, visualise the density of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) vessel detections around infrastructure, or determine which marine protected areas (MPAs) contain wind, oil, or other infrastructure types. These are only examples of the types of questions we can now ask. Offshore fixed infrastructure is a first of its kind dataset that not only brings to light the extensive industrialization of our oceans, but enables users across industries to use this information in research, monitoring and management.</p> <h2>Use cases</h2> <ul> <li>Maritime domain awareness</li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure locations can support maritime domain awareness, and understanding of other activities occurring at sea.</li> <li>Infrastructure data supports assessments of ocean industrialization, facilitating monitoring of areas experiencing build-up or new development</li> </ul> <li>Monitoring vessels</li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure locations can be used to analyse the behaviour of vessels associated with infrastructure, including grouping vessels based on their interaction with oil and wind structures.</li> <li>Interactions between vessels and infrastructure can help quantify the resources required to support offshore industrial activity</li> <li>The impacts of infrastructure on fishing, including attracting or deterring fishing, can be analysed.</li> </ul> <li>Marine protected areas (MPAs) and marine spatial planning</li> <ul> <li>During the planning stage in the designation of new protected areas, knowing the location of existing infrastructure will be vital to understand which stakeholders shall be included in the consultation process, to understand potential conflicts, and identify easy wins.</li> </ul> <li>Environmental impacts</li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure locations can be used to help detect marine pollution events, and to differentiate between types of pollution events (e.g. pollution from vessels versus pollution from platforms)</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Caveats</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites do not sample most of the open ocean.</strong></li> <ul> <li>Most industrial activity happens relatively close to shore.</li> <li>The extent and frequency of SAR acquisitions is determined by the mission priorities.</li> <li>For more info see: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06825-8/figures/5</li> </ul> <li><strong>We do not provide detections of infrastructure within 1 km of shore</strong></li> <ul> <li>We do not classify objects within 1 km of shore because it is difficult to map where the shoreline begins, and ambiguous coastlines and rocks cause false positives.</li> <li>The bulk of industrial activities, including offshore development with medium-to-large oil rigs and wind farms, occur several kilometers from shore.</li> </ul> <li> <strong>False positives can be produced from noise artifacts.</strong> </li> <ul> <li>Rocks, small islands, sea ice, radar ambiguities (radar echoes), and image artifacts can cause false positives</li> <li>Detections in some areas including Southern Chile, the Arctic, and the Norwegian Sea have been filtered to remove noise.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Spatial coverage varies over time, which can produce different detections results year on year - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://share.cleanshot.com/yG0qfF\"> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Example</span> </a></strong> </li> <ul> <li>Infrastructure detentions from 2017-01-01 to near real time are available, and updated on a monthly basis.</li> </ul> <li> <strong>Labels can change over time</strong> </li> <ul> <li>The label assigned to a structure is the greatest predicted label averaged across time.

All feedback is greatly appreciated.</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Methods</h2> <h3>SAR imagery</h3> <p>We use SAR imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) [1]. The images are sourced from two satellites (S1A and S1B up until December 2021 when S1B stopped operating, and S1A only from 2022 onward) that orbit 180 degrees out of phase with each other in a polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Each satellite has a repeat-cycle of 12 days, so that together they provide a global mapping of coastal waters around the world approximately every six days for the period that both were operating. The number of images per location, however, varies greatly depending on mission priorities, latitude, and degree of overlap between adjacent satellite passes. Spatial coverage also varies over time [2]. Our data consist of dual-polarization images (VH and VV) from the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, with a resolution of about 20 m.</p> <p>[1] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sedas.satapps.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sentinel-1_User_Handbook.pdf\"> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://sedas.satapps.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sentinel-1_User_Handbook.pdf</span> </a> </p> <p>[2]<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario\"> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\"></span> <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario</span> </a> </p> <h3>Infrastructure detection by SAR</h3> <p>Detecting infrastructure with SAR is based on the widely used Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, an anomaly detection method conceived for detecting ships in synthetic aperture radar images, that has been modified to remove non-stationary objects. This algorithm is designed to search for pixel values that are unusually bright (the targets) compared to those in the surrounding area (the sea clutter). This method sets a threshold based on the pixel values of the local background (within a window), scanning the whole image pixel-by-pixel. Pixel values above the threshold constitute an anomaly and are likely to be samples from a target.</p> <h3>Infrastructure classification</h3> <p>To classify every detected offshore infrastructure, we used deep learning and designed a ConvNet based on the ConvNeXt architecture. A novel aspect of our deep learning classification approach is the combination of SAR imagery from Sentinel-1 with optical imagery from Sentinel-2. From six-month composites of dual-band SAR (VH and VV) and four-band optical (RGB and NIR) images, we extracted small tiles for every detected fixed infrastructure, with the respective objects at the center of the tile. A single model output includes the probabilities for the specified classes: wind, oil, unknown, lake maracaibo, and noise.</p> <h3>Filtering</h3> <p>GFW post-processed the classified SAR detections to reduce noise (false positives), remove vessels, exclude areas with sea ice at high latitudes, and incorporate expert feedback. We used a clustering approach to identify detections across time (within a 50 m radius) that were likely the same structure but their coordinates differed slightly, and assigned them the greatest average predicted label of the cluster. We also filled in gaps for fixed structures that were missing in one timestep but detected in the previous and following timesteps, and dropped detections appearing in a single timestep. Finally, the dataset underwent extensive manual review and editing by researchers and industry experts in order to refine the final product, and provide the most accurate dataset possible.</p> <h3>Data field descriptions</h3> <p>Each detection has a unique individual identifier (<em>detection_id</em>). A six-month image composite is used in the classification, therefore the <em>detection_date</em> represents the middle of the six month period. This helps to remove non-stationary objects (i.e. vessels), and avoid confusion in the model if a structure is being built, or there isn’t adequate imagery available. <em>structure_id</em> allows you to track a structure through time. There are therefore many <em>detection_id</em> (one for each month the structure is detected) for each <em>structure_id</em>.

    "description": "Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vessel’s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing presence algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction. The algorithm classifies each AIS broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. AIS data as broadcast may vary in completeness, accuracy and quality. Also, data collection by satellite or terrestrial receivers may introduce errors through missing or inaccurate data. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing presence algorithm is a best effort mathematically to identify “apparent fishing activity.” As a result, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified as such by Global Fishing Watch; conversely, Global Fishing Watch may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies designations of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch is taking steps to make sure fishing activity designations are as accurate as possible. Global Fishing Watch fishing presence algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and automated classification techniques.",

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a spaceborne radar imaging system that can detect at-sea vessels and structures in any weather conditions. Microwave pulses are transmitted by a satellite-based antenna towards the Earth surface. The microwave energy scattered back to the spacecraft is then measured and integrated to form a “backscatter” image. The SAR image contains rich information about the different objects on the water, such as their size, orientation and texture. SAR imaging systems overcome most weather conditions and illumination levels, including clouds or rain due to the cloud penetrating property of microwaves, and daylight or darkness due to radar being an “active” sensor (it shoots and records back its own energy). SAR gives an advantage over some other “passive” satellite sensors, such as electro-optical imagery, consisting of a satellite-based camera recording the sunlight/infrared radiation reflected from/emitted by objects on the ground. This latter method can be confounded by cloud cover, haze, weather events and seasonal darkness at high latitudes.</p>\n<h2>Use cases</h2>\n<ul>\n <li>Monitor vessel presence (both fishing and non-fishing) in areas of interest such as marine protected areas (MPAs), exclusive economic zones (EEZs), inshore exclusion zones (IEZs) and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs).</li>\n <li>Assess presence of vessels that don’t show up on cooperative tracking systems—including automatic identification system (AIS) and vessel monitoring system (VMS)—near vulnerable marine ecosystems and essential fish habitats.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Limitations</h2>\n<ul>\n <li><b>Sentinel-1 SAR data does not sample most of the open ocean.</b></li>\n <ul>\n <li>Sentinel-1 does not sample most of the open ocean. However, the vast majority of industrial activity is close to shore. Also, farther from shore, more fishing vessels use AIS (60-90%), far more than the average for all fishing vessels (about 25%). Thus, for most of the world, our detection data complemented by AIS will capture the vast majority of human activity in the global ocean.</li>\n </ul>\n <li><b>False positives can be produced from image artifacts (noise).</b></li>\n <li><b>We do not provide detections of vessels 1 kilometer from shore as it’s difficult to accurately map where the shoreline begins.</b></li>\n <ul>\n <li>We do not include objects within 1 km of shore because of ambiguous coastlines and rocks. Nor do we include objects in much of the Arctic and Antarctic, where sea ice can create too many false positives; in both regions, however, vessel traffic is either very low (Antarctic) or in countries that have a high adoption of AIS (northern European or northern North American countries). The bulk of industrial activities occur several kilometers from shore, such as fishing along the continental shelf break, ocean transport over shipping lanes, and offshore development on medium-to-large oil rigs and wind farms. Also, much of the vessel activity within 1 km of shore is by smaller boats such as pleasure crafts.</li>\n </ul>\n <li><b>Vessel detection by SAR imagery is limited primarily by the resolution of the images (~20 m in the case of Sentinel-1 IW GRD products).</b></li>\n <ul>\n <li>As a result, we miss most vessels under 15 m in length, although an object smaller than a pixel can still be seen if it is a strong reflector, such as a vessel made of metal rather than wood or fiberglass. Especially for smaller vessels (25 m), detection also depends on wind speed and the state of the ocean, as a rougher sea surface will produce higher backscatter, making it difficult to separate a small target from the sea clutter. Conversely, the higher the radar incidence angle, the higher the probability of detection, as less backscatter from the background will be received by the antenna. The vessel orientation relative to the satellite antenna also matters, as a vessel perpendicular to the radar line of sight will have a larger backscatter cross section, increasing the probability of being detected.</li>\n </ul>\n <li><b>Vessel length estimates are limited by the quality of ground truth data</b></li>\n <ul>\n <li>Although we selected only high-confidence AIS-SAR matches to construct our training data, we found that some AIS records contained an incorrectly reported length. These errors, however, resulted in only a small fraction of imprecise training labels, and deep learning models can accommodate some noise in the training data.</li>\n </ul>\n <li><b>Not all geographies are covered equally</b></li>\n <ul>\n <li>Our fishing classification may be less accurate in certain regions. In areas of high traffic from pleasure crafts and other service boats, such as near cities in some countries and in the fjords of Norway and Iceland, some of these smaller craft might be misclassified as fishing vessels. Conversely, some misclassification of fishing vessels as non-fishing vessels is expected in areas where all activity is not publicly shared. More importantly, however, is that many industrial fishing vessels are between 10 and 20 meters in length, and the detection capability of our model falls off quickly within these lengths. As a result, the total number of industrial fishing vessels is likely significantly higher than what we detect.</li>\n <li>Our data likely underestimates the concentration of fishing in some regions, where we see areas of vessel activity being \"cut off\" by the edge of the Sentinel-1 footprint and we miss very small vessels (e.g., most artisanal fishing) that are less likely to carry AIS devices.</li>\n </ul>\n</ul>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<h3>SAR imagery</h3>\n<p>We use SAR imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) [1]. The images are sourced from two satellites (S1A and S1B up until December 2021 when S1B stopped operating, and S1A only from 2022 onward) that orbit 180 degrees out of phase with each other in a polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Each satellite has a repeat-cycle of 12 days, so that together they provide a global mapping of coastal waters around the world approximately every six days for the period that both were operating. The number of images per location, however, varies greatly depending on mission priorities, latitude, and degree of overlap between adjacent satellite passes. Spatial coverage also varies over time [2]. Our data consist of dual-polarization images (VH and VV) from the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, with a resolution of about 20 m.</p>\n<p>[1]\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sedas.satapps.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sentinel-1_User_Handbook.pdf\">\n <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://sedas.satapps.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sentinel-1_User_Handbook.pdf</span>\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>[2]<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario\">\n <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\"></span>\n <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario</span>\n </a>\n</p>\n<h3>Detection footprints</h3>\n<p>Detection footprints are areas within each satellite scan (or scene) that our system uses to perform detections. These filters help to keep relevant detections and exclude data that may be inaccurate. Detection footprints are smaller than the total scene as they exclude any land areas and islands, and exclude a 500 meter buffer from the boundaries of the scene and a 1 kilometer buffer from shorelines.</p>\n<h3>Filtering</h3>\n<p>GFW has post-processed the SAR detections to reduce noise (false positives), remove offshore infrastructure from this layer focused on vessels, and exclude areas with sea ice at high latitudes.</p>\n<h3>Vessel detection by SAR</h3>\n<p>Detecting vessels with SAR is based on an known as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR), a threshold algorithm used for anomaly detection in radar imagery. This algorithm is designed to search for pixel values that are unusually bright (the targets) compared to those in the surrounding area (the sea clutter). This method sets a threshold based on the pixel values of the local background (within a window), scanning the whole image pixel-by-pixel. Pixel values above the threshold constitute an anomaly and are likely to be samples from a target, and therefore are included as a detection.</p>\n<h3>Vessel presence and length estimation</h3>\n<p>To estimate the length of every detected object and also to identify when our CFAR algorithm made false detections, we designed a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) based on the modern ResNet (Residual Networks) architecture. This single-input/multi-output ConvNet takes dual-band SAR image tiles of 80 by 80 pixels as input, and outputs the probability of object presence (known as a “binary classification task”) and the estimated length of the object (known as a “regression task”).</p>\n<h3>Fishing and non-fishing classification</h3>\n<p>To identify whether a detected vessel was a fishing or non-fishing vessel we use a machine learning model. For this classification task we used a ConvNeXt architecture modified to process the following two inputs: the estimated length of the vessel from SAR (a scalar quantity) and a stack of environmental rasters centered at the vessel’s location (a multi-channel image). This multi-input-mixed-data/single-output model passes the raster stack (11 channels) through a series of convolutional layers and combines the resulting feature maps with the vessel length value to perform a binary classification: fishing or non-fishing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The environmental layers used to differentiate between fishing and non-fishing include:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>vessel density (based on SAR)</li>\n <li>average vessel length (based on SAR)</li>\n <li>bathymetry</li>\n <li>distance from port</li>\n <li>hours of non-fishing vessel presence, under 50 m (from AIS)</li>\n <li>hours of non-fishing vessel presence, over 50 m (from AIS)</li>\n <li>average surface temperature</li>\n <li>average current speed</li>\n <li>standard deviation of daily temperature</li>\n <li>standard deviation of daily current speed</li>\n <li>average chlorophyll</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>AIS matching and vessel identity</h3>\n<p>AIS data can reveal the identity of vessels, their owners and corporations, and fishing activity. Not all vessels, however, are required to use AIS devices, as regulations vary by country, vessel size, and activity. Vessels engaged in illicit activities can also turn off their AIS transponders or manipulate the locations they broadcast. Also, large “blind spots” along coastal waters arise from nations that restrict access to AIS data that are captured by terrestrial receptors instead of satellites or from poor reception due to high vessel density and low-quality AIS devices. Unmatched SAR detections therefore provide the missing information about vessel traffic in the ocean.</p>\n<h3>SAR and AIS matching</h3>\n<p>Matching SAR detections to vessels’ GPS coordinates (from the automatic identification system (AIS) is challenging because the timestamp of the SAR images and AIS records do not coincide, and a single AIS message can potentially match to multiple vessels appearing in the image, and vice versa. To determine the likelihood that a vessel broadcasting AIS corresponded to a specific SAR detection, we followed a matching approach based on probability rasters of where a vessel is likely to be minutes before and after an AIS position was recorded. These rasters were developed from one year of global AIS data from the Global Fishing Watch pipeline which uses Spire Global and Orbcomm sources of satellite data, including roughly 10 billion vessel positions, and computed for six different vessel classes, considering six different speeds and 36 time intervals. So we obtain the likely position of a vessel that could match a SAR detection based on the vessel class, speed and time interval.</p>\n<h3>AIS matching and vessel identity</h3>\n<p>Automatic identification system (AIS) data can reveal the identity of vessels, their owners and corporations, and fishing activity. Not all vessels, however, are required to use AIS devices, as regulations vary by country, vessel size, and activity. Vessels engaged in illicit activities can also turn off their AIS transponders or manipulate the locations they broadcast. Also, large “blind spots” along coastal waters arise from nations that restrict access to AIS data that are captured by terrestrial receptors instead of satellites or from poor reception due to high vessel density and low-quality AIS devices. Unmatched SAR detections therefore provide the missing information about vessel traffic in the ocean.</p>\n<h2>Resources, code and other notes</h2>\n<p>All code developed in this study for SAR detection, deep learning models, and analyses is open source and freely available at\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/paper-industrial-activity\">\n <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/paper-industrial-activity</span>\n </a>.\n</p>\n<h2>Source data and citations</h2>\n<p>All vessel data are freely available through the Global Fishing Watch data portal at\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://globalfishingwatch.org\">\n <span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">https://globalfishingwatch.org</span>\n </a>.

    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. Global Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily. Read more about this product, and download the data <a href=\"https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.Those using night light detections data should acknowledge the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat presence. A filtration algorithm has been applied but there may still be some mis-identification. The GFW layer includes quality flags (QF), including a filter to show only detections which NOAA has classified as vessels (QF1)",

Data is collected using their VMS via satellites and terrestrial receivers, and contains a vessel identities, gear type, location, speed, direction and more. Global Fishing Watch analyzes this data using the same algorithms developed for automatic identification system (AIS) data to identify fishing activity and behaviors. The algorithm classifies each broadcast data point for these vessels as either apparently fishing or not fishing and shows the former on the Global Fishing Watch fishing activity heat map. VMS broadcasts data quite differently from AIS and may give different measures of completeness, accuracy and quality. Over time our algorithms will improve across all our broadcast data formats. Global Fishing Watch’s fishing presence algorithm for VMS, as for AIS, is a best effort to algorithmically identify “apparent fishing activity.” It is possible that some fishing activity is not identified, or that the heat map may show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies the terms “fishing activity,” “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied upon solely at your own risk. Global Fishing Watch fishing presence algorithms are developed and tested using actual fishing event data collected by observers, combined with expert analysis of AIS vessel movement data resulting in the manual classification of thousands of known fishing events. Global Fishing Watch also collaborates extensively with academic researchers through our research program to share fishing activity classification data and automated classification techniques."

    "description": "The night lights vessel detections layer, known as visible infrared imaging radiometer suite or VIIRS, shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light they emit at night. Though not exclusively associated with fishing vessels, this activity layer is likely to show vessels associated with activities like squid fishing, which use bright lights and fish at night.The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting automatic identification system (AIS) and so are not represented in the AIS apparent fishing effort layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded. Global Fishing Watch ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s Earth Observation Group, located in Boulder, Colorado. The data, known as VIIRS boat detections, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, regions closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one over-pass daily. Read more about this product, and download the data <a href=\"https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.Those using night light detections data should acknowledge the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particles hit the sensors on a satellite, this can create a false signal which might cause the algorithm to recognize it as a boat presence. A filtration algorithm has been applied but there may still be some mis-identification. The GFW layer includes quality flags (QF), including a filter to show only detections which NOAA has classified as vessels (QF1)",
